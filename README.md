# Latent Walk

We're using the Pytorch implementation of Stylegan2, available [here](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada-pytorch).

There was no need to change the code as it contains everything to easily train on a new dataset. The one we used in the project contains a little more than 800 images. The dataset is available on the lab's server.
